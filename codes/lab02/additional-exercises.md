If you finish the lab earlier, you may try to also:
* Implement active learning sampling with 1%, 5%, and 10% retraining of the most uncertain points, and compare the performance with a baseline that performs just well. Hint: Use probabilities (or distance from the hyperplane, if you use LinearSVC) to determine the most uncertain points.
* Implement a classification with rejection approach, where you then plot the performance of the kept and rejected samples.
